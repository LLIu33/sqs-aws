# nodeSQS Sample Project

## Requirements

    npm install

## Basic Configuration

You need to set up your AWS security credentials before the sample code is able
to connect to AWS. You can do this by creating a file named "credentials" at ~/.aws/ 
(C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\ for Windows users) and saving the following lines in the file:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key id>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>

See the [Security Credentials](http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials) page.
It's also possible to configure your credentials via a configuration file or
directly in source. See the AWS SDK for Node.js [Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html)
for more information.

## Running

    node server.js
